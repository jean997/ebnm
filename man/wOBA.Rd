\description{
Weighted on-base average (wOBA) for hitters from the 2022 Major League Baseball
(MLB) season. Standard errors are calculated by modeling hitting outcomes as
multinomially distributed and plugging in empirical proportions as the "true"
outcome probabilities. To handle small sample sizes, standard errors are
lower bounded by the errors that would be obtained using league-wide
proportions rather than the plug-in estimates.
